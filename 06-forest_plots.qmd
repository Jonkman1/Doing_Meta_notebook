# Forest Plots

## Theorie:
It is conventional to visualize the results of meta-analyses through forest plots. Forest plots contain a graphical representation of each studyâ€™s effect size and confidence interval, and also show the calculated overall effect. Furthermore, they contain the effect size data that was used for pooling.

It is also possible to add other kinds of information to a forest plot, for example the quality rating that each study received. Forest plots can only display results assuming a fixed significance threshold, usually $p<0.05$. To visualize how results change for varying significance thresholds, drapery plots can be generated in addition.
