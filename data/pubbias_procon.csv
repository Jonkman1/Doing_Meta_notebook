"","Method","Advantages","Disadvantages"
"1","Duval & Tweedie Trim-and-Fill"," Easy to implement in R \n  Very heavily used in practice \n  Can be interpreted by most researchers"," Often fails to correct the effect size enough, for example when the true effect is zero BREAK  Not robust when the heterogeneity is very large BREAK  Usually outperformed by other methods BREAK  Inclusion of ""imputed"" studies may produce corrected effect size CIs that are actually too narrow."
"2","PET-PEESE"," Based on a simple, intuitive model \n  Results are easy to interpret"," Can sometimes  massively over- or underestimate the effect BREAK  This is particularly problematic when small-study effects were not caused by publication bias BREAK  Weak performance for meta-analyses with few studies, low sample sizes, and high heterogeneity"
"3","Limit Meta-Analysis"," Similar approach as PET-PEESE, but explicitly models between-study heterogeneity \n  Less likely to produce massively over-/underestimated effects (compared to PET-PEESE)"," Performance is less well studied than the one of other methods BREAK  May fail when the number of studies is very low (<10) and heterogeneity very high"
"4","P-Curve"," Has been shown to outperform other methods (particularly trim-and-fill) when its assumptions are met"," Works under the assumption of no heterogeneity, which is unlikely in practice BREAK  Requires a minimum number of significant effect sizes BREAK  Less easy to interpret and report "
"5","Selection Models"," Can potentially model any kind of assumed selection process \n  Three-Parameter Selection Model has shown good performance in simulation studies"," Only valid when the selection model describes the publication bias process adequately BREAK  Assume that other small-study effects are not relevant BREAK  Can be difficult to interpret and require background knowledge"
